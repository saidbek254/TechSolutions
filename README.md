## **Challenge Overview**: Your mission is to locate the TechSolutions company server. Begin by gathering information about the server's configuration and identify any misconfigured files that may contain credentials. Use this information to log into the company's internal website, where additional credentials will grant you access to the server. Once inside, your goal is to navigate the server and discover the hidden flag.
